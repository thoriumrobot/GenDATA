# Enhanced Graph-Based Framework with Large Input Support

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive framework to handle larger CFG inputs with proper dataloading, batching, and dynamic sizing for all annotation type models. The framework supports CFG graphs with up to **1000 nodes** and **2000 edges**, a significant increase from the previous ~20 nodes and ~40 edges.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **CFG DataLoader (`cfg_dataloader.py`)**
- **Dynamic Size Limits**: Configurable maximum nodes (1000) and edges (2000)
- **Intelligent Padding**: Automatically pads smaller graphs to max size
- **Truncation Support**: Handles graphs exceeding size limits
- **Custom Batching**: Fixed PyTorch Geometric batching issues with proper batch tensor handling
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple graphs in batches

### 2. **Enhanced Graph Models (`enhanced_graph_models.py`)**
- **Enhanced GCN Model**: Multi-layer GCN with residual connections and attention pooling
- **Enhanced GAT Model**: Multi-head attention with 8 heads and residual connections
- **Enhanced Transformer Model**: Graph transformer with edge encodings and layer normalization
- **Enhanced Hybrid Model**: Combines GCN, GAT, and Transformer with attention fusion
- **Attention Pooling**: Sophisticated global pooling strategies for better graph representation

### 3. **Enhanced Training Framework (`enhanced_training_framework.py`)**
- **Large Input Support**: Trains models on CFG graphs up to 1000 nodes
- **Batch Training**: Efficient batch processing with proper memory management
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Optional logging and visualization support
- **Auto-Training**: Automatic training of missing models
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Detailed training metrics and model performance tracking

### 4. **Enhanced Predictor (`enhanced_graph_predictor.py`)**
- **Large CFG Processing**: Handles CFG graphs up to 1000 nodes during inference
- **Batch Prediction**: Efficient batch processing for multiple files
- **High Confidence Predictions**: Improved accuracy with sophisticated architectures
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing interfaces

## Technical Improvements

### **Size Limits Increased**

- **Residual Connections**: Added throughout all architectures
- **Global Pooling**: Multiple pooling strategies (mean, max, sum, attention)

### **Batching and Memory Management**
- **Custom Collator**: Fixed PyTorch Geometric batching issues
- **Batch Size**: Configurable batch sizes up to 16

## Usage Examples

### **Training Enhanced Models**
```bash
# Train all enhanced hybrid models with large input support
python enhanced_training_framework.py --base_model_type enhanced_hybrid \
  --epochs 50 --max_nodes 1000 --max_edges 2000 --max_batch_size 16
```

### **Using Enhanced Predictor**
```python
from enhanced_graph_predictor import EnhancedGraphPredictor

predictor = EnhancedGraphPredictor(
    models_dir='models_annotation_types',
    max_nodes=1000,
    max_edges=2000,
    max_batch_size=16
)

# Load enhanced models
predictor.load_trained_models('enhanced_hybrid')

# Predict with large CFG support
predictions = predictor.predict_annotations_for_file_with_cfg(
    java_file, cfg_dir, threshold=0.3
)
```

### **Custom Size Limits**
```python
from cfg_dataloader import CFGSizeConfig

# Update size limits dynamically
CFGSizeConfig.update_limits(
    max_nodes=2000,      # Even larger graphs
    max_edges=4000,      # More complex graphs
    max_batch_size=32    # Larger batches
)
```
