   * Returns the number of times {@link Cache} lookup methods have successfully loaded a new value.
   * This is usually incremented in conjunction with {@link #missCount}, though {@code missCount} is
   * also incremented when an exception is encountered during cache loading (see {@link
   * #loadExceptionCount}). Multiple concurrent misses for the same key will result in a single load
   * operation. This may be incremented not in conjunction with {@code missCount} if the load occurs
   * as a result of a refresh or if the cache loader returned more items than was requested. {@code
   * missCount} may also be incremented not in conjunction with this (nor {@link
   * #loadExceptionCount}) on calls to {@code getIfPresent}.
