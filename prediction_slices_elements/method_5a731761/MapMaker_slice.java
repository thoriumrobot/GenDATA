  /**
   * Sets the minimum total size for the internal hash tables. For example, if the initial capacity
   * is {@code 60}, and the concurrency level is {@code 8}, then eight segments are created, each
   * having a hash table of size eight. Providing a large enough estimate at construction time
   * avoids the need for expensive resizing operations later, but setting this value unnecessarily
   * high wastes memory.
