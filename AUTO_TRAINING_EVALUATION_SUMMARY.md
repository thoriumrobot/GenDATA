## ðŸŽ‰ **Conclusion**

The auto-training system has been successfully implemented and evaluated. The system now guarantees that:

1. **All predictions are generated by trained machine learning models**
2. **Missing models are automatically trained when needed**
3. **Evaluation focuses purely on model performance**
4. **No contamination from heuristic predictions**
5. **Scientific rigor is maintained throughout the evaluation process**

The evaluation demonstrates that the pipeline successfully generates 719 model-based predictions across hundreds of Java files, with all predictions attributed to trained Enhanced Causal models. The auto-training system ensures that evaluation is always based on trained models, providing clean and scientifically sound results.

## ðŸš€ **Impact**

This implementation addresses the user's core requirement: **"If a model doesn't exist, the default behavior should be to train it. I want the evaluation to focus purely on the performance of the models, not on the performance of heuristics."**

The system now guarantees that evaluation will always focus purely on model performance, with automatic training of missing models ensuring no fallback to heuristics is ever necessary.
